                    <p>
                        Techpark English offers a full refund if the cancellation is made within 7 days of the initial
                        purchase of any course or training program.

                    <p><strong>Pro-Rated Refunds</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        After the initial 7-day period, refunds are provided on a pro-rated basis based on the amount of
                        course content accessed and the time elapsed since the purchase.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Course Completion</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        No refunds are granted if the course is more than 50% completed or if more than 30 days have passed
                        since the purchase, whichever comes first.

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Subscription Services</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        For subscription-based services, cancellations can be made at any time, but refunds will only apply
                        to future billing cycles. No partial month refunds are provided.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Special Promotions</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Courses purchased during special promotions or discounts are not eligible for refunds unless
                        specified otherwise in the promotion’s terms and conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Refund Request Process</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        To request a refund, customers must contact Techpark English’s customer support team via email or
                        the company’s website, providing proof of purchase and reason for the refund request.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Processing Time</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Refund requests are processed within 14 business days after approval. Refunds are credited back to
                        the original payment method.
